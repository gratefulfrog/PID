    <h1>PID Controller Demo</h1>
    <p>This is a Processing.js web-based version of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a> following a sinusoidal displacement. The red target moves back and
      forth according to a sin law. It's linear and angular velocity are adjustable by the large buttons. Hovering the mouse over the
      button will display the resulting velocity in case of click.
    </p>
    <p>The green follower knows nothing of the behavior of the target. It simply measures the distance between the target center and
      its own center and feeds that to the PID as error input with a setpoint of 0. The PID calculates a new horizontal velocity for the
      follower.
    </p>
    <p>The radius of the follower is is a weighted maximum for the last 10 cycles. The idea is to keep the radius as small as possible.
    </p>
    <p> The values of Kp,Ki,Kd were empirically determined by means of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegler%E2%80%93Nichols_method">Ziegler-Nichols method.</a> You can manually adjust the
      Kp,Ki,Kd parameters to see the consequences on the follower's behavior.
